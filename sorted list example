#==============Explanation=================
#1  getting input as given range
#2  [m for name, m in l]===> getting all values from list l
#2  set[m for name, m in l]===> get unique value from the list its converted in set
#2  list(set([m for name, m in l])))==> its reconverted at list
#2  sorted(list(set([m for name, m in l])))==>sort the list
#2 sorted(list(set([m for name, m in l])))[1]==>take 2nd lowest value
#3 printing the name and mark of student that has the second lowest mark by iterating through the sorted list.
#If the condition matches, the result list is appended to tuple  -`[a for a,b in sorted(l) if b == sh])` 
#now join the list with \n - newline to print name and mark of student with second largest mark
#print('\n'.join([a for a,b in sorted(l) if b ==sh))
